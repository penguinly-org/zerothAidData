            "Key action": "Maintain an open airway so the person can continue to breathe normally.",
            "Introduction": "An unresponsive and breathing person has normal, regular breathing, but does not respond to any sound or touch from another person. A person may become unresponsive due to an injury (e.g., hitting their head) or a medical condition (e.g., diabetic emergency) that may indicate a greater danger to their health. Even if the person is breathing regularly, they may still be at risk because their muscles could relax causing their tongue to fall back and block their airway. First aid providers should consider accessing medical care. If the unresponsive person’s breathing stops, becomes noisy or they sound like they are gasping for air or hardly breathing, they may be in cardiac arrest. See Unresponsive and abnormal breathing for baby and child or adolescent and adult.",
            "Guidelines": "The AVPU scale may be used to determine the level of responsiveness: Alert – Verbal – Pain – Unresponsive describes what kind of stimulus a person reacts to and can be used to determine the level of responsiveness. A first aid provider using the AVPU scale should maintain an open airway for any person reacting to Pain (in addition to Unresponsive).* In a non-traumatic incident (no risk of spine injury), first aid providers should maintain an open airway for a person who is unresponsive and breathing normally by moving them onto their side and tilting their head back (recovery position).*",
            "Good practice points": "If a person is found motionless (e.g., lying on the ground), their responsiveness and breathing should be checked immediately:\n> shout and shake or tap gently\n> open their airway\n> take up to ten seconds to check for normal breathing.\n• In a non-traumatic incident (no risk of spinal injury), if the first aid provider cannot move the person into the recovery position, they can use the head-tilt-chin-lift or jaw thrust manoeuvres to maintain an open airway.\n• The first aid provider should avoid moving a person with a suspected spinal injury:\n> If medical help will arrive soon, the head-tilt-chin-lift or jaw thrust manoeuvres can be used to maintain an open airway on a person with a suspected spine injury. The jaw thrust manoeuvre may result in less cervical spine movement than the head-tilt-chin-lift manoeuvre.\n> If medical help is some time away and if there is more than one first aid provider present, the person can be turned into a side-lying position while maintaining spinal alignment.\n• A person who is pregnant and unresponsive may be placed in the recovery position on their left side. This prevents compression of blood vessels which feed the uterus.\n• The cause of unresponsiveness (e.g., diabetic emergency, poisoning, head injury) should be identified if possible.\n• First aid providers should regularly check the person’s breathing while maintaining an open airway.\n• First aid providers should always access emergency medical services (EMS) for an unresponsive person who is breathing normally, as this may indicate a serious condition.",
            "Chain of survival behaviours": "Prevent and prepare\n• Follow instructions from your healthcare provider to manage any pre-existing health conditions.\n• Wear and use appropriate safety equipment when working or participating in leisure and work activities.\nEarly recognition\nCheck for a response by gently shaking the person’s shoulders or if they are a baby, tap their foot. Speaking loudly and clearly, ask a question such as, “Are you alright?”.\nIf the person responds, continue with your assessment. (See General approach.)\nIf the person is unresponsive, they will not move or respond to any noise or touch.\nIf the person does not respond:\n1. Open their airway: Gently tilt their head back (or into a neutral position for a baby) until their mouth falls open and lift their chin. (You may need to turn the person onto their back to do this.) The jaw thrust manoeuvre might result in less cervical spine movement than the head tilt, which may be useful to consider when you suspect a Spinal injury.\n2. Check for breathing: Keeping their airway open, look, listen and feel for normal breathing for up to ten seconds. Look for chest or abdominal movement; listen for breathing sounds; feel for air on your cheek.\nFirst aid steps\nIf the person is breathing normally:\n1. Move them onto their side and tilt their head back (or into a neutral position if it is a baby) to maintain an open airway. This is called the recovery position. A baby can be held in this position in your arms.\n2. Access emergency medical services (EMS).\n3. Monitor the person for any changes in their breathing or level of response. If possible, try to establish why the person is unresponsive.\n• If it is impractical to move the person onto their side, the head-tilt-chin-lift or jaw thrust manoeuvres (or neutral position if it is a baby) can be used to maintain an open airway.\nCAUTION\n• If you suspect a spine injury, maintain an open airway by using the head-tilt-chin-lift or jaw thrust manoeuvres only and access emergency medical services (EMS).\n• If medical care is some time away and if there is more than one first aid provider present, you can turn the person into a side-lying position while maintaining spinal alignment.\nAccess help\n• When speaking to EMS, specify that the person is unresponsive and breathing normally.

This may enable them to get into a comfortable position and call for help."
